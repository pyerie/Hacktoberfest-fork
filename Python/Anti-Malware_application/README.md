# A ML-based anti-malware program written in Python #

<p> I first created this project for a competition. I had to learn a lot of new stuff and take inspiration(and a bit of code) from others who had tried similar projects before. This project uses customtkinter and scikit-learn to handle the GUI and ML operations respectively. It utilizes a decision tree classifier to classify files as malware or benign. It can classify a single file or all the files in a folder. It currently only works with executable files(but can be modified to work with other file types). Using the PEfile library, this program extracts information from the executable file(s) to classify them. 


Note: It is not perfect and is prone to a lot of false-positives, but I hardly encountered any false-negatives. I think this is due to the overfitting of the model.

### Installation and execution

1) Install the necessary libraries
```
pip3 install customtkinter
pip3 install tkinter
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install sklearn
pip3 install pefile
pip3 install numpy

```

2) Execute the program
```
python3 anti-malware.py
```

Happy learning!
